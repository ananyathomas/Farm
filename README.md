Problem Statement

Technical: Agri Tech App

Our Approach

Farming, which has existed since the dawn of humanity, is no longer considered as traditional and conservative as it used to be. Modern farming is digital, technological, and innovative; and with a growing number of people to feed, this trend is likely to continue. The main goal of our website is to optimize farming processes.

Weather Forecast
Weather forecasts in agriculture should be precise and refreshed constantly. Though technology has made farmers less dependent on the environment, the weather is still an important factor when it comes to growing crops. Weather forecast integration is a useful feature for agriculture.

List of diseases and symptoms
We will provide a useful reference for farmers by including a list of crops, possible diseases, and symptoms. 

Help
We will also provide the facility for the farmers to send in their queries and provide a list of helplines.

Government Schemes
The welfare of farmers has been the top priority of the Government of India. For this, it has implemented different schemes or yojanas to revive the agriculture sector and to improve the economic conditions of farmers. Our website aims to deliver information regarding these schemes so that farmers can benefit from this.

Crop calculator
We will also provide a tool to help the farmers calculate total crop population.
